pd-grainders (granular synthesis in Pd)
=============================

This repository contains a few patches to perform granular synthesis. From sample-based granulation to live-input to synthesised sound. Constantly growing and changing.

List of tools:

input_grainder. Stores incoming audio to a delay line and performs basic granular synthesis operations.

file_grainder. Takes a mono soundfile (.wav) and performs granular synthesis on it.

osc_grainder. Granular synthesis with sine waves.

pulse_grainder. Granular synthesis with unit-pulses and karplus-strong resonances.
