gs (granular synthesis in Pd)
=============================

This repository contains a few patches to perform granular synthesis. From sample-based granulation to live-input to synthesised sound. Constantly growing and changing.

List of tools:

ig - input granulator. Stores incoming audio to a delay line and performs basic granular synthesis operations.

fg - file granulator. Takes a mono soundfile (.wav) and performs granular synthesis on it.

pg - pulse granulator. Granular synthesis with unit-pulses and karplus-strong resonances.

sg - sine granulator. Granular synthesis with sine waves.
